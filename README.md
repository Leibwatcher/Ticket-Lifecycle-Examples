  The lifestyle of a ticket: An Admin, End-Users or Customers run into a problem and then creates a "Ticket", then it's sent off to the Departments for anyone to resovle the issue. Someone from a Department activates the ticket and resovles the issue and then closes the "Ticket".

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

Customers/end-user can create Tickets on any issue they may have.

After creating a ticket, creating or ends-user it will notify that the ticket was receive successfully.

Help Desk Agent/Admin logs in are authorized to look and see what have been assigned and what was not assigned that is provided priority. The priority is set by queue manager or help desk that work on tickets. The example underneath shows latest Update, Ticket #, Subject, From(where the ticket is coming form), Priority and Assigned To(This is where the queue manager or the Help Desk Agent can assign to themselves or assigned to a team.)

With tickets being recieved, it's like a order in the mail. "Entire Mobile Online Banking is Down" is the new ticket that has arrived. It's set as "Normal" but we are going to change it to "Emeragency". For this could impact the business. So to updated is to click on Priority: "Normal" and change it to Emergenacy. Additonally as a Admin or Help Desk Agent you can click on "Unassigned" and sign to yourself or another.

For the next ticket I set "Adobe Reader is not Working for The Account Dept" to Aryn Lee. These will be updated for everone to see in the "open ticket" section.

Other team memebers can reply to tickets that they are not assgined to. As a team you can fix the problem and close the tickets depending on the "Priority".
